## 📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on **automated ship detection from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images**.  
SAR images are widely used in **remote sensing** because they can capture clear images even under **cloud cover, fog, or night conditions** — making them perfect for **maritime surveillance, border security, and defense operations**.

Our goal is to leverage **Computer Vision + Deep Learning** to accurately detect ships from noisy SAR datasets.
